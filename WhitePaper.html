        ROARING PANDA – WHITEPAPER 2024</header><p>Roaring Panda: A Revolutionary Cryptocurrency</p>
   
   <p>Executive Summary</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda (RPDA) is a next-generation deflationary cryptocurrency set to revolutionize the digital asset landscape. With a total supply of 10 billion coins and a strategic distribution plan, Roaring Panda aims to provide sustainable value growth and long-term stability for its holders. Launching on August 5th, 2024, Roaring Panda will introduce innovative mechanisms to counteract inflationary pressures and ensure robust liquidity.</p>
   
   <p>Introduction</p>
   
   <p>Welcome to the Roaring Panda Token, a revolutionary cryptocurrency initiative dedicated to financial growth and wildlife conservation. Launching on the Base Network, the Roaring Panda Token leverages blockchain technology to support the protection of endangered pandas while providing transparent and lucrative opportunities for investors.</p>
   
   <div></div>
   <div><img src="img/WhitePaper6.png"></div>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Our Mission and Vision</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Vision</p>
   
   <p>To establish a sustainable and transparent financial ecosystem that promotes both digital asset growth and environmental stewardship. We strive to engage our community in meaningful actions that support panda conservation while offering robust investment opportunities.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Mission</p>
   
   <p>To harness the power of blockchain to create a valuable digital asset while dedicating efforts and resources to the protection of endangered pandas. By integrating financial innovation with environmental conservation, we aspire to make a meaningful impact on preserving these majestic creatures.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">The Origin of the Name "Roaring Panda"</p>
   
   <p>The name "Roaring Panda" is derived from a blend of symbolism and intention, encapsulating the essence and vision of our cryptocurrency.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">4.1. Roaring:</p>
   
   <p>The term "roaring" signifies strength, power, and a bold presence. It represents our ambition to make a significant impact in the cryptocurrency market. Much like a roar, we aim to be heard and recognized as a formidable force that commands attention and respect.</p>
   
   <p>It also implies growth and expansion, echoing our mission to continuously evolve and expand our ecosystem, ensuring sustained interest and engagement from the community.</p>
   
   <<p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Panda:</p>
   
   <p>The name "Panda" is inspired by the panda, an animal that is universally recognized and beloved. Pandas symbolize peace, gentleness, and approachability, qualities that we wish to imbue within our cryptocurrency.</p>
   
   <p>The panda also represents rarity and uniqueness, aligning with our deflationary model that emphasizes scarcity and value appreciation over time.</p>
   
   <p>Together, "Roaring Panda" conveys a dynamic balance of strength and approachability, rarity and presence, positioning our cryptocurrency as both a powerful and appealing asset in the digital market.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Our Purpose</p>
   
   <p>The purpose of Roaring Panda is to create a sustainable and deflationary cryptocurrency that addresses the common challenges faced by digital assets today, such as inflation, volatility, and market manipulation. Our goal is to offer a secure and valuable investment opportunity that grows over time, providing our holders with long-term benefits.</p>
   
   <<p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">What We Strive to Achieve</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Sustainable Value Growth:</p>
   
   <p>By implementing deflationary mechanisms such as scheduled coin burns, we aim to reduce the total supply of RPDA over time, thereby increasing its scarcity and value. This ensures that our holders benefit from the appreciating value of their assets.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Market Stability:</p>
   
   <p>Our strategic distribution plan, including phased airdrops and liquidity lock, is designed to prevent pump-and-dump scenarios and market manipulation. This helps maintain a stable market environment, fostering investor confidence and long-term engagement.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4"></p>Broad Adoption and Utility:</>
   
   <p>We aim to expand the utility of RPDA through strategic partnerships, integrations with major exchanges, and the development of real-world use cases. This will enhance the demand and usability of Roaring Panda, driving its adoption and relevance in the digital economy.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Community-Centric Governance:</p>
   
   <p>By incorporating decentralized governance through a DAO, we empower our community to participate in key decisions, ensuring that the development and direction of Roaring Panda align with the interests of its users. This fosters a sense of ownership and involvement among our holders.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Security and Compliance:</p>
   
   <p>Ensuring the highest levels of security through rigorous smart contract audits and compliance with relevant regulations is paramount. This protects our holders' investments and builds trust within the community.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Vision for the Future</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda envisions a future where digital assets are not only a means of speculative investment but also a stable and reliable store of value. By addressing the fundamental issues of inflation and market instability, we strive to set a new standard for cryptocurrencies, one where long-term growth and stability are achievable and accessible to all.</p>
   
   <p>Our mission is to lead by example, demonstrating that with innovative mechanisms and a community-centric approach, a cryptocurrency can provide real and lasting value. As we move forward, we are committed to continuous improvement, expansion, and adaptation to meet the evolving needs of the digital asset market.</p>
   
   <p>In essence, Roaring Panda aims to be more than just a cryptocurrency; it aspires to be a cornerstone of the future digital economy, offering strength, stability, and sustained growth to its holders.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Launching on Base Chain</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda will be launched on the Base Chain, known for its high security, scalability, and efficiency. This choice of blockchain ensures that Roaring Panda benefits from a robust technological foundation, capable of handling high transaction volumes with minimal fees and delays. The Base Chain's ecosystem also offers extensive interoperability with other blockchains, enhancing the utility and reach of RPDA.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Ensuring Robust Liquidity </p>
   
   <p>To ensure market stability and build investor confidence, Roaring Panda's liquidity will be locked for 365 days. This measure prevents large-scale liquidity removal, which can lead to market crashes and loss of investor confidence. By locking liquidity, Roaring Panda demonstrates a commitment to long-term stability and sustainable growth.</p>
   
   <p>Mechanisms to Counteract Inflationary Pressures</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda incorporates deflationary mechanisms that are designed to counteract inflationary pressures, ensuring the gradual reduction of the total supply and thereby increasing the value of each coin over time.</p>
   
   <p>Scheduled Coin Burns: Regularly scheduled burns, determined by community votes and milestone achievements, further reduce the total supply. This participatory approach ensures that the community has a say in the deflationary process, aligning with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. </p>
   
   <p>Anti-Whale Measures: Limits on the amount of RPDA that can be held or transacted by a single wallet at the presale prevent large-scale holders from manipulating the market. These measures ensure a more stable and fair market environment. At the presale, a single wallet can hold maximum of 0.5% 0f presale allocation (which is maximum 500,000 RPDA coins).</p>
   
   <p>Vesting schedule: The airdrop of the coin will be distributed on 03 different intervals to prevent and minimize the pump and dump of the post launch of the token. The vesting schedule is explained later in this white paper. </p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Buyback and Burn Plan</p>
   
   <p>A core component of the Roaring Panda Token strategy is our Buyback and Burn Plan. This plan is designed to increase the token's value and ensure long-term growth by reducing the circulating supply through systematic buybacks and burns.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Buyback Strategy</p>
   
   <p>After the launch of the Roaring Panda Token, the team will initiate a buyback program, purchasing 5% of the total supply, equivalent to 500 million coins. This buyback will be executed to stabilize the market and enhance token value by reducing the circulating supply.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Burn Wallet</p>
   
   <p>The purchased tokens of 500 million coins will be stored in the burn wallet and everyone can check the wallet status.</p>
   
   <p>Burn Wallet Address: 0xdf9f29E38b63Af266F790658598d58Df3D6e4Cd7</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Burn Schedule </p>
   
   <p>At first, tokens in Burn Wallet will be systematically burned based on the market capitalization milestones:</p>
   
   <p>Market Cap $10 million: 1% of total supply (100 million coins) burned from Burn Wallet </p>
   
   <p>Market Cap $50 million: 1% of total supply (100 million coins) burned from Burn Wallet </p>
   
   <p>Market Cap $100 million: 1% of total supply (100 million coins) burned from Burn Wallet </p>
   
   <p>Community votes and burn plan: the burn plan and the percentage of the rest 2% of the coins in the burn wallet (200 million coins) will be decided by the community votes. This ensures that the community has a direct say in the token's deflationary measures, promoting transparency and engagement.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Tokenomics</p>
   
   <p>The Roaring Panda Token is structured to ensure growth and a significant contribution to panda conservation. Below are the detailed breakdown of our tokenomics:</p>

   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">CEX Listing Fund</p>
   
   <p>To facilitate the listing of Roaring Panda Token on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and cover associated expenses, 2% of the total supply (200 million coins) will be allocated for this purpose. Listing on multiple exchanges will enhance liquidity and accessibility.</p>

   <p>Public Allocation: 80% (8 billion coins) Fund Allocation</p>
   
   <p>Presale and Airdrop Vesting Schedule</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4"> Presale Allocation</p>
   
   <p>To incentivize early investment and provide a foundation for the token's initial market liquidity, 10% of the total supply (1 billion coins) will be allocated for presale. These presale tokens will be available to early investors at a special rate, ensuring that the token has a strong launchpad and initial trading volume. However, a single wallet, at the presale, can only hold 0.5% of the presale allocations (which is 500,000 coins)</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4"> Airdrop Allocation</p>
   
   <p>The airdrop tokens will be distributed via two dedicated wallets, each holding 5% of the total supply (500 million coins). Any unsold coins at the presale will be burned. Investors can verify this via our two airdrop wallets. </p>
   
   <p>Airdrop Wallet 1: 0xa0E8d29FBFcF49906d1285dA880D9D761E532211</p>
   
   <p>Airdrop Wallet 2: 0x82bb994b49DA144b7bddb667330c1E1D8D9fec6c</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Vesting Schedule</p>
   
   <p>The airdrop will be executed in three stages to ensure a fair and orderly distribution, minimizing the risk of pump-and-dump schemes and protecting all investors:</p>
   
   <p>August 04, 2024: Early investors will receive their first 33.33% of the airdrop coins to their wallets</p>
   
   <p>September 04, 2024: Early investors will receive their second 33.33% of the airdrop coins to their wallets</p>
   
   <p>October 04, 2024: Early investors will receive their last 33.34% of the airdrop coins to their wallets</p>
   
   <p>This structured release will help maintain market stability and provide ongoing incentives for early investors and community members to hold and support the Roaring Panda Token.</p>

   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4"></p>Our Roadmap</p>
   <div><img src="img/WhitePaper1.jpeg"></div>
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Transparency and Security</p>
   
   <p>Transparency and security are core principles of the Roaring Panda Token project. All wallet activities are publicly accessible and verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring that the community can trust and verify our actions.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Conclusion</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda's tokenomics are meticulously crafted to establish a balanced and sustainable growth model. This thoughtful design addresses several critical aspects that are essential for the long-term success and stability of any cryptocurrency.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Market Stability</p>
   
   <p>By allocating a substantial portion of the supply (80%) to liquidity and future operational needs, Roaring Panda ensures that there is sufficient liquidity to support trading activities and minimize volatility. The inclusion of a dedicated 2% for CEX liquidity further reinforces market stability by facilitating smooth and reliable trading on centralized exchanges. Additionally, the phased airdrop distribution plan prevents sudden dumps in the market, protecting the coin's value from excessive short-term speculation.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Community Engagement</p>
   
   <p>The 10% allocation for airdrops is aimed at rewarding early adopters and building a loyal community base. By distributing these coins in two phases, Roaring Panda encourages ongoing participation and interest from its community members. This engagement is further supported by the 4% marketing allocation, which will be used to continually promote and grow the community, ensuring that the project remains vibrant and active.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Long-term Value Appreciation</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda's deflationary model, highlighted by the buy-back and burn program, is a key component in driving long-term value appreciation. By purchasing 10% of the total supply from the market and systematically burning these coins, the total supply of RPDA will decrease over time. This reduction in supply, coupled with sustained demand, is expected to increase the scarcity and value of the remaining coins, benefiting all holders.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Strategic Allocation</p>
   
   <p>The allocation of 2% for the team aligns their interests with the success of the project, incentivizing them to work towards the long-term growth and stability of Roaring Panda. Similarly, the 2% reserved for Panda Protection ensures that the project can respond to unforeseen challenges and opportunities, further securing its future.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Vision of Robust and Resilient Cryptocurrency</p>
   
   <p>Roaring Panda is more than just a digital asset; it is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to thrive in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Our strategic allocation of funds, combined with innovative mechanisms such as the phased airdrop distribution and the buy-back and burn program, positions Roaring Panda as a robust and resilient cryptocurrency. This thoughtful approach ensures that Roaring Panda can adapt to market dynamics, protect investor interests, and continue to grow and deliver value to its stakeholders.</p>
   
   <p class="text-primary fs-5 mb-4">Commitment to Stakeholders</p>
   
   <p>Our commitment to creating a balanced and sustainable growth model reflects our dedication to the long-term success of Roaring Panda and its community. By addressing market stability, fostering community engagement, and implementing mechanisms for long-term value appreciation, we aim to build a cryptocurrency that is not only a valuable investment but also a cornerstone of the future digital economy. Roaring Panda is poised to set new standards in the cryptocurrency space, offering strength, stability, and sustained growth to all its stakeholders.</p>
